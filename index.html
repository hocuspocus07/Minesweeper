                    <h2>How to Play Minesweeper</h2>
                    <p><pre>
                        <h1>Objective:</h1>
                        The objective of Minesweeper is to clear the board without detonating any mines.
                        
                    <h1>Rules:</h1>
                        1. The Grid: Minesweeper is played on a grid of squares.
                           
                        2. Mines: Hidden throughout the grid are mines. The number of mines and the size of the grid can vary based on the difficulty level you choose (easy, medium, hard).
                        
                        3. Clearing Squares:
                           - Clicking on a square reveals what's underneath it:
                             - If it's a mine, the game is over.
                             - If it's empty, the square will display a number indicating how many mines are adjacent to it.
                             - If a square has no adjacent mines, it will automatically reveal adjacent empty squares.
                           
                        4. Flagging Mines:
                           - Right-click (or long press on mobile) to place a flag on a square you suspect contains a mine.
                           - This helps you keep track of where you think the mines are.
                           
                        5. Winning the Game:
                           - You win the game by revealing all the squares that do not contain mines.
                           - Once all safe squares are revealed, the game is won!
                           
                        6. Losing the Game:
                           - If you click on a square that contains a mine, the game is over.
                           - Be careful! Use the numbers to help deduce where the mines are.
                           
                        7. Useful Tips:
                           - The numbers displayed on the squares indicate how many mines are adjacent to that square.
                           - Use logic and deduction to strategically clear squares and flag potential mines.
                           - Start by clicking on squares that are most likely safe, based on the numbers revealed.
                           - Sometimes you may need to take a guess, especially in larger grids.
                        
                        <h1>Controls:</h1>
                        - Left Click: Reveal a square.
                        - Right Click (or Long Press): Place a flag on a suspected mine.
